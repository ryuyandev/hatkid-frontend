# Hatkid Website Front End
This repository holds the front end for Hatkid's website. It shows whether or not HatKid is live and displays an image based on what he is streaming.

Due to the simplicity of this project, it does not utilize a front end framework, but it makes use of Parcel.js for bundling. It is hosted via Github Pages and automatically builds and deploys on commits to the master branch.

The project runs in tandem with a simple Express.js API, located [here](https://github.com/ryuyandev/twitch-api).

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install necessary packages
2. Run `npm run dev` to develop locally
3. Run `npm run build` to create dist files for deployment
